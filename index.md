# Computing in Context Data Analysis

#### Hi, this is Chloe Yu. Welcome to my analytical portfolio site! 

We will experiment with some basic building blocks of data manipulations, dive deep into the messy real world datasets and understand their relationships, and attempt to validate or disprove a hypothesis based on our analysis.

(section-label)=

## [Project 1: Data Manipulation](project_1.ipynb). 

Learn the essential building blocks of data manipulation. This project focuses on cleaning, organizing, and transforming messy datasets to uncover actionable insights.

## [Project 2: Relationship Analysis & Visualization](project_2.ipynb). 

Dive into data relationships and bring them to life through compelling visualizations. See how patterns and trends emerge when datasets are paired with powerful visualization tools.

## [Project 3: Hypothesis Testing & Stastical Analysis](project_3.ipynb). 

Put hypotheses to the test! This project showcases statistical methods to validate (or disprove) claims and generate meaningful conclusions from data.
